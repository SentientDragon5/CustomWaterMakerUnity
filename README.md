A tool for Unity to make rivers through terrain with a script that generates custom Meshes.

This tool can make water for rivers that you have created with terrain.
You simply attach the script to your GameObject, then add verticies to the list. The editor that I made allows
for simple tasks like Moving, Rotating, and Extending in Scene View. 
When you want to see what the mesh looks like, click the "Bake" button (it wouldn't let me update it in OnValidate)
